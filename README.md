## STM32F031 Template

Ongoing process for creating a easy to use, open development environment for STM32F031 chips.

### Notes
* Uses internal 8Mhz RC oscillator to generate 48Mhz system clock using PLL
* Programming and debugging requires OpenOCD installed on the system.
* "STM32F4 Discovery" board is used as a "ST-LINK/V2" JTAG adapter.
